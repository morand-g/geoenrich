Available variables
===================

Please note that some of the variables marked as *ongoing* may be updated with a delay of several months. As such, the most recent data is not always available. In these cases, there are often other datasets that provide these data for the most recent months or years.

.. note::
  If you want to use Copernicus data, you need to install Copernicus Marine API (`instructions <https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/7970514-copernicus-marine-toolbox-installation>`_) and set it up with your Copernicus account (`instructions <https://help.marine.copernicus.eu/en/articles/8185007-copernicus-marine-toolbox-credentials-configuration>`_).


.. note::
  If you want to use FSLE data, you need to save your Avso+ credentials in a .netrc file as explained (`here <https://opendap.github.io/documentation/tutorials/ClientAuthentication.html>`_).
